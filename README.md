# Structures
Structures are used to group together data of different types inside a single unit. It removes one of the key limitations of arrays which can only store data elements with similiar types.
Thus, structures can be used in situations where data elements with distinct data types are required to be stored as a single entity; Example:- a student record containing data elements such as name,roll no., marks etc.
